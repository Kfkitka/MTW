            <p><i>&ldquo;In Bogota, I saw that a textbook approach to teaching empathy wasn&rsquo;t working. Students&rsquo; eyes were glazed over, their bodies were limp, and they weren&rsquo;t connecting conflict resolution lessons to the conflicts in their lives. Bullying and violence remained prevalent, and students were disengaged. The breakthrough moment came one day at recess, as I watched students dance to reggaeton with passion. As a lifelong dancer, I knew movement could engage students in building character and promoting civic engagement.  I approached the physical education teacher to discuss how we could use something the students and I both loved, creative movement, to inspire peaceful behavior.&rdquo;</i></p>

Some of the employees are still saying hello to each other by their signs. I would recommend your program to any fellow manager that is looking to engage their employees in a positive way while developing, learning and gaining a great understanding of empathy towards people who are different!&rdquo;</i></p>
